This repository hosts the source code for my personal website, **[phillip-codes.com](https://phillip-codes.com/)**. The site showcases my work, experience, and projects as I pursue my MS in Computer Science at Columbia University. It serves as a digital portfolio, providing insight into my journey as an aspiring software engineer.

### Features

### Purpose

This website was designed to give visitors a detailed look into my technical skills and projects, as well as to offer an easy way for potential employers or collaborators to connect with me.

I built this site using **TypeScript** to learn the language in preparation for my role at **Relativity Space**. It also reflects my passion for design and UI, blending my coding skills with an aesthetic I enjoy. This project allowed me to merge both the technical and creative aspects of web development.

### Development

The site is built using modern web development practices and technologies. It is continuously updated to reflect new projects and changes in my professional journey.
